cd financial-pre-accounting-agent-beta

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run start
```

4. Choose your preferred theme (Mustard theme is default in v3.1.2)
5. Set up backup preferences

---

## 💼 Usage Examples

### Document Management

```
📁 Document Flow
1. Import financial document (PDF/image/Word)
2. Automatic data extraction and classification
3. Review and confirm extracted data
4. Document stored with metadata in appropriate directory
5. Data added to financial database for reporting and tax calculations
```

**Example**: Importing an Invoice

1. Go to "Document Manager"
2. Click "Import Document" or drag-and-drop
3. The system automatically:
   - Extracts vendor/client information
   - Identifies invoice number and date
   - Detects currency and amounts
   - Classifies as incoming or outgoing
4. Review and confirm the extracted data
5. Click "Save" to add to your document database

### Tax Calculations

**Finance Law 2025 Corporate Income Tax Example**:

For a company with:
- Annual Revenue: 5,000,000 MAD
- Expenses: 3,750,000 MAD
- Net Taxable Income: 1,250,000 MAD

The progressive tax calculation would be:
- First 300,000 MAD @ 17.5% = 52,500 MAD
- Next 700,000 MAD @ 20.0% = 140,000 MAD
- Remaining 250,000 MAD @ 22.75% = 56,875 MAD
- **Total Income Tax**: 249,375 MAD
- **Effective Tax Rate**: 19.95%

**Minimum Contribution Check**:
- 0.25% of turnover = 12,500 MAD
- Since calculated tax (249,375 MAD) > minimum contribution (12,500 MAD), the calculated tax applies

### Financial Reports

1. Go to "Reports" section
2. Select "Quarterly Financial Summary"
3. Choose date range (e.g., Q1 2025)
4. Click "Generate Report"
5. Review the on-screen preview

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start

**Issue**: The application fails to launch after installation.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   node --version

   Ensure you're using Node.js v12-v21 (v22+ not supported yet)

2. **Reinstall dependencies**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. **Check application logs** for specific error messages:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\financial-pre-accounting-agent-beta\logs`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/financial-pre-accounting-agent-beta/logs`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/financial-pre-accounting-agent-beta/logs`

4. **Use the restart script**:
   ```bash
   ./restart-app.bat    # Windows
   ```

#### UI Elements Not Responding

**Issue**: Buttons, menu items, or other UI elements aren't responding to clicks.

**Solutions**:
1. **Restart the application** using the restart-app.bat script

2. **Clear application cache**:
   ```
   Settings → System → Clear Application Cache
   ```

3. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors:
   ```
   View → Toggle Developer Tools → Console tab
   ```

#### No Documents Showing

**Issue**: Imported documents don't appear in the Document Manager.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check import directory**:
   ```
   Settings → Document Storage → Check configured paths
   ```

2. **Restart application** after importing your first document

3. **Verify file permissions** on the document storage directory

#### Tax Calculations Not Working

**Issue**: Tax calculations show errors or incorrect values.

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify tax rules file**:
   ```
   resources/tax-rules/finance-law-2025.json
   ```
   Ensure this file exists and is properly formatted

2. **Update application** to latest version for current tax rules

3. **Check console** for JavaScript errors:
   ```
   View → Toggle Developer Tools
   ```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### For Large Document Sets

If you're working with a large number of documents (1000+), consider these optimizations:

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Import documents in batches of 50-100 rather than all at once
   - Schedule imports during off-hours using the scheduler feature

2. **Storage Management**:
   - Use the "Archive Old Documents" feature for documents older than 3 years
   - Enable the "Compress Images" option in document settings

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Run "Optimize Database" from the Settings → Maintenance menu monthly
   - Increase the cache size if you have sufficient RAM

### Hardware Recommendations

For optimal performance with large document sets (5000+ documents):

- **CPU**: Quad-core processor or better
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 5GB free space
- **Display**: Full HD (1080p) or higher resolution

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Best Practices

To maximize security:

1. **Regular Backups**: Use the built-in backup feature
2. **Update Regularly**: Install updates for security patches
