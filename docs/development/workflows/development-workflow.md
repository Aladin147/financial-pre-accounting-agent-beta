## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for the Financial Pre-Accounting Agent Beta project. It establishes clear processes and guidelines to maintain focus, ensure consistency, prevent distractions, and deliver high-quality software efficiently. By following these workflows, we can maintain momentum and avoid the pitfalls that led to previous project issues.

## Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Daily Planning (15 minutes)

- Review your objectives for the day
- Identify the 2-3 most important tasks
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Check dependencies before starting tasks
- Review related documentation to ensure proper context

### 2. Focus Blocks (2-hour sessions)

- Work in uninterrupted 2-hour focus blocks
- Disable notifications during focus blocks
- Use physical or digital "do not disturb" indicators
- Stay within the scope of the selected task
- Take brief breaks between focus blocks

### 3. Code and Documentation Synchronization

- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Document design decisions immediately, not after the fact
- Ensure code comments reflect current implementation
- Cross-reference related documents in commit messages
- Keep KNOWN_ISSUES.md updated with any discovered issues

### 4. End-of-Day Wrap-up (15 minutes)

- Document progress made during the day
- Commit and push completed work
- Update task status in project management system
- Identify any blockers or issues discovered
- Prepare tasks for the next day

## Weekly Development Cadence

### 1. Monday: Planning and Preparation

- Team planning meeting (30 minutes)
- Review previous week's accomplishments
- Set clear goals for the current week
- Assign tasks and responsibilities
- Identify potential blockers and dependencies

### 2. Tuesday-Thursday: Focus on Implementation

- Prioritize implementation work
- Conduct code reviews promptly
- Hold short, focused stand-ups (15 minutes)
- Minimize meetings and interruptions
- Address blockers immediately

### 3. Friday: Review and Documentation

- Code review catch-up (ensure all PRs are reviewed)
- Documentation updates and verification
- Weekly retrospective (30 minutes)
- Demo of completed features
- Clean up branches and prepare for next week

## Git Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy

- `master`: Stable production code
- `develop`: Integration branch for development
- `feature/<feature-name>`: Individual feature development
- `bugfix/<bug-id>`: Bug fixes
- `release/<version>`: Release preparation
- `hotfix/<issue-id>`: Production hotfixes

### 2. Branching and Merging Rules

- Always branch from the latest `develop`
- Keep branches focused on a single feature or fix
- Update from `develop` regularly to minimize conflicts
- Squash commits before merging to keep history clean
- Delete branches after merging

### 3. Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- Commit regularly to avoid large, complex commits
- Ensure all tests pass before committing

## Task Management

### 1. Task Definition

- Each task must have clear acceptance criteria
- Define tasks with measurable outcomes
- Estimate complexity and time requirements
- Identify dependencies upfront
- Link tasks to requirements or user stories

### 2. Task States

- **Backlog**: Defined but not scheduled
- **Ready**: Scheduled and ready to work on
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Review**: Code complete and awaiting review
- **Testing**: Being tested for acceptance
- **Done**: Completed and accepted

### 3. Task Focus

- Work on one task at a time to maintain focus
- Complete started tasks before taking on new ones
- If blocked, document clearly before switching tasks
- Avoid context switching when possible
- Flag tasks requiring assistance early

## Distraction Management

### 1. Identifying Distractions

Common distractions include:

- Unplanned feature requests
- Scope creep during implementation
- "Shiny new technology" syndrome
- Premature optimization
- Excessive meetings or interruptions
- Non-urgent communications

### 2. Handling New Feature Requests

- Document all new feature requests in the backlog
- Assess impact on current sprint/milestone
- Only add to current work if critical
- Schedule non-critical requests for future sprints
- Require proper specification before consideration

### 3. Scope Containment

- Reference requirements when making implementation decisions
- Question additions that weren't in original requirements
- Use the "parking lot" technique for good ideas that aren't urgent
- Maintain a separate "future enhancements" document
- Request stakeholder approval for scope changes

### 4. Technology Adoption Process

- Document proposed technology and its benefits
- Perform risk assessment of the new technology
- Create proof of concept before full adoption
- Schedule dedicated time for evaluation
- Make adoption decisions as a team

## Meeting Discipline

### 1. Meeting Guidelines

- Have a clear agenda distributed in advance
- Define specific outcomes for each meeting
- Stick to scheduled time limits
- Take notes and record action items
- End with clear next steps and responsibilities

### 2. Meeting Types and Frequency

- **Daily Standup**: 15 minutes, every day
- **Sprint Planning**: 1 hour, beginning of sprint
- **Sprint Review**: 1 hour, end of sprint
- **Technical Discussion**: As needed, 30 minutes
- **Design Review**: As needed, 1 hour
- **Retrospective**: 1 hour, end of sprint

### 3. Meeting Alternatives

Consider these alternatives before scheduling a meeting:

- Asynchronous discussion in project management tool
- Shared document with comments
- Brief video recording explaining an issue
- Chat discussion with summary
- Office hours instead of scheduled meetings

## Communication Protocols

### 1. Synchronous Communication

- Reserve for urgent matters and complex discussions
- Prefer scheduled over ad-hoc interruptions
- Document outcomes after synchronous discussions
- Set clear agendas and timeboxes
- Consider recording important discussions for reference

### 2. Asynchronous Communication

- Use for most non-urgent matters
- Be clear and provide sufficient context
- Include links to relevant documents or code
- Set clear expectations for response time
- Structure messages for easy consumption

### 3. Communication Channels

- **Project Management Tool**: Task-related communication
- **Code Reviews**: Code-specific feedback
- **Documentation**: Long-term knowledge
- **Team Chat**: Quick questions and team coordination
- **Email**: External communication and formal announcements
- **Meetings**: Complex discussions and decision-making

## Progress Tracking

### 1. Individual Progress Tracking

- Update task status daily
- Track time spent on tasks
- Document blockers and issues
- Record deviations from estimates
- Keep notes on solutions and approaches

### 2. Team Progress Tracking
