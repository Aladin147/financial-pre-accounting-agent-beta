## Overview

This document outlines a disciplined approach to code refactoring in the Financial Pre-Accounting Agent Beta project. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior to improve its internal structure. A strategic approach to refactoring helps maintain code quality, reduces technical debt, and prevents the introduction of bugs.

## When to Refactor

Refactoring should be considered in the following situations:

### 1. Code Smell Identification

Refactor when you identify code smells, including:

- **Duplicated Code**: The same code structure appears in multiple places
- **Long Methods**: Methods that are too long to understand easily
- **Large Classes**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Long Parameter Lists**: Methods with too many parameters
- **Divergent Change**: A class is changed for multiple reasons
- **Shotgun Surgery**: A change requires many small edits to multiple classes
- **Feature Envy**: A method uses features of another class more than its own
- **Data Clumps**: The same group of variables used together in multiple places
- **Primitive Obsession**: Using primitive types instead of small objects
- **Switch Statements**: Complex conditional logic that could be polymorphic

### 2. Technical Debt Reduction

Refactor to address technical debt:

- **Legacy Code**: Outdated patterns or approaches
- **Low Test Coverage**: Code difficult to maintain due to insufficient tests
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Inefficient implementations
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Code patterns known to be insecure
- **Accessibility Issues**: UI code not meeting accessibility standards

### 3. Preparation for New Features

Refactor to prepare for new functionality:

- **Before adding new features** to an area with poor code quality
- **When extending functionality** in a way not supported by current design
- **Prior to API changes** that will impact multiple components
- **During technology migrations** to bring code up to current standards

### 4. Regular Maintenance

Regular refactoring as part of maintenance:

- **Code review follow-up**: Addressing issues identified in reviews
- **During bug fixes**: Improving the surrounding code when fixing bugs
- **Scheduled refactoring**: Regular time allocated for debt reduction

## Refactoring Approval Process

To ensure refactoring is properly evaluated and planned:

### 1. Small Refactorings (Developer-Driven)

For small, isolated refactorings:

- **Self-approval**: Developer documents refactoring in commit message
- **Test coverage**: Verifies with tests before and after
- **Code review**: Normal review process applies

### 2. Medium Refactorings (Team-Driven)

For refactorings affecting multiple components:

- **Team discussion**: Presented in team meetings
- **Impact assessment**: Document affected areas
- **Test strategy**: Define approach to verify behavior preservation
- **Code review**: At least two reviewers required

### 3. Large Refactorings (Project-Driven)

For architectural or cross-cutting refactorings:

- **Formal proposal**: Written document with rationale and approach
- **Architecture review**: Review by architecture team
- **Risk assessment**: Formal evaluation of risks and mitigations
- **Phased implementation plan**: Breaking into manageable chunks
- **Project tracking**: Tracked as project tasks with milestones
- **Multiple reviewers**: Code reviews by domain experts

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

To reduce the risk of refactoring:

### 1. Testing Requirements

- **Comprehensive tests**: Ensure thorough test coverage before refactoring
- **Test-driven refactoring**: Write tests first for uncovered areas
- **Automated tests**: All refactoring must be verified by automated tests
- **Regression testing**: Run full test suite after each refactoring
- **Manual testing**: UI changes may require additional manual testing

### 2. Incremental Approach

- **Small steps**: Make small, verifiable changes rather than big rewrites
- **Frequent commits**: Commit after each successful step
- **Feature flags**: Use flags to gradually roll out large refactorings
- **Parallel implementations**: For critical systems, run old and new side by side
- **Blue/green deployment**: Deploy refactored code alongside original

### 3. Clear Documentation

- **Purpose documentation**: Clearly document refactoring goals
- **Architectural decisions**: Document key decisions and alternatives
- **Known limitations**: Document any known limitations or edge cases
- **Migration guidelines**: For API changes, document migration paths
- **Before/after examples**: Provide examples of code before and after

## Refactoring Techniques

Common refactoring patterns to apply:

### 1. Function-Level Refactorings

- **Extract Method**: Break large methods into smaller, focused methods
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Replace long parameter lists with objects
- **Remove Flag Arguments**: Replace boolean flags with polymorphism
- **Preserve Whole Object**: Pass whole objects instead of multiple attributes
- **Replace Temp with Query**: Replace temporary variables with method calls

### 2. Class-Level Refactorings

- **Extract Class**: Move related fields and methods to new class
- **Move Method**: Move method to class that uses it most
- **Replace Inheritance with Composition**: Favor composition over inheritance
- **Extract Interface**: Define interface for a subset of class functionality
- **Introduce Design Patterns**: Apply appropriate design patterns

### 3. React Component Refactorings

- **Extract Hook**: Create custom hooks for reusable logic
- **Component Composition**: Break large components into smaller ones
- **Memoization**: Add memoization to prevent unnecessary renders
- **State Management**: Move complex state to appropriate management tools
- **Prop Drilling Reduction**: Use context or state management for deep props

### 4. Service-Level Refactorings

- **Interface Extraction**: Clearly define service interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Invert dependencies to depend on abstractions
- **Service Registration**: Ensure proper registration with ServiceRegistry
- **Error Handling Standardization**: Apply consistent error handling
- **Lifecycle Management**: Implement standard lifecycle methods

## Documenting Refactoring Decisions

All significant refactorings should be documented:

### 1. Pre-Refactoring Documentation

Before starting a non-trivial refactoring:

- **Problem statement**: Clear description of issues being addressed
- **Goals and non-goals**: What the refactoring aims to achieve
- **Approach**: Overview of planned refactoring techniques
- **Impact assessment**: Components affected and potential risks
- **Testing strategy**: How behavior preservation will be verified

### 2. Commit Messages

Refactoring commit messages should include:

- **Refactor prefix**: Start with "refactor:" to clearly identify
- **Purpose**: Brief statement of what was refactored
- **Approach**: Techniques used
- **Testing**: Confirmation of testing performed
- **Related issues**: Link to related issues or tickets

Example: `refactor: Extract validation logic from UserService into dedicated ValidationService. All unit tests pass, including new tests for ValidationService.`

### 3. Post-Refactoring Documentation

After completing a significant refactoring:

- **Summary of changes**: Overview of what was changed
- **Architecture updates**: Updates to architecture documentation
- **Migration guide**: If API changes, guide for migration
- **Performance impact**: Any observed performance changes
- **Lessons learned**: Insights for future refactorings

## Measuring Refactoring Success

Metrics to evaluate refactoring effectiveness:

### 1. Code Quality Metrics

- **Complexity reduction**: Cyclomatic complexity before and after
- **Code duplication**: Duplicate code percentage
- **Test coverage**: Coverage percentage before and after
- **Static analysis**: Issues identified by static analysis tools
- **Maintainability index**: Standard maintainability metrics

### 2. Process Metrics

- **Bug density**: Bugs per unit of code before and after
- **Development velocity**: Speed of subsequent feature development
- **Onboarding time**: Time for new developers to understand the code
- **Code review efficiency**: Time spent in code reviews
- **Build performance**: Build and test execution times

## Special Considerations for Financial Pre-Accounting Agent

For this specific project, consider:

### 1. Financial Accuracy

- **Validation logic refactoring**: Extra care with financial calculations
- **Side-by-side verification**: Run old and new code in parallel
- **Audit trail**: Ensure audit capabilities maintained during refactoring
- **Compliance considerations**: Maintain regulatory compliance
- **Data integrity**: Preserve strict data integrity requirements

### 2. UI Component Refactoring

- **Purple theme consistency**: Maintain visual consistency with theme
- **Accessibility preservation**: Ensure accessibility features preserved
- **Performance benchmarks**: Maintain UI performance metrics
- **Browser compatibility**: Test across supported browsers
- **Responsive design**: Verify responsiveness on different viewports

### 3. Service Architecture Considerations

- **Service boundaries**: Respect established service boundaries
- **Registry compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with ServiceRegistry
- **Event propagation**: Preserve event handling mechanics
- **Error reporting**: Maintain consistent error reporting
- **Configuration management**: Preserve configuration capabilities
