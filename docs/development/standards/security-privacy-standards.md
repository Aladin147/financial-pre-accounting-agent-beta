# Security and Privacy Standards

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** April 4, 2025  
**Status:** Approved  
**Owner:** Security Team  

## Overview

This document outlines the security and privacy standards for the Financial Pre-Accounting Agent Beta project. Given the financial nature of our application, security and privacy are critical concerns that must be addressed systematically throughout all aspects of development, deployment, and maintenance.

## General Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

Implement multiple layers of security controls:

- **Perimeter Security**: Network-level protections
- **Application Security**: Secure coding practices
- **Data Security**: Encryption and access controls
- **User Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **System Security**: Regular updates and hardening

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

Restrict access rights to the minimum necessary:

- **User Privileges**: Users access only what they need
- **Service Accounts**: Limited to required operations
- **Application Permissions**: Minimal required system access
- **Developer Access**: Environment-specific access controls
- **Third-Party Integration**: Minimal required permissions

### 3. Secure by Design

Incorporate security from the beginning:

- **Threat Modeling**: Identify threats during design
- **Security Requirements**: Include in feature requirements
- **Secure Architecture**: Design with security in mind
- **Security Testing**: Include in testing strategy
- **Security Reviews**: Regular code and architecture reviews

### 4. Privacy by Design

Build privacy protections into all processes:

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for stated purposes
- **User Control**: Give users control over their data
- **Data Lifecycle**: Clear policies for retention and deletion
- **Privacy Impact**: Assess privacy impact of features

## Secure Coding Standards

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - Use standard authentication libraries and frameworks
   - Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate
   - Store credentials securely (e.g., using password hashing)
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - Enforce password complexity requirements

2. **Authorization Controls**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Validate permissions on both client and server
   - Re-authenticate for sensitive operations
   - Implement proper session management
   - Log access control decisions

### Input Validation and Output Encoding

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all input data (type, length, format, range)
   - Use whitelist validation rather than blacklist
   - Validate on the server side, not just client side
   - Validate structured data against schemas
   - Handle validation failures gracefully

2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Encode data before displaying to prevent XSS
   - Use context-appropriate encoding (HTML, JavaScript, CSS)
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Set appropriate security headers
   - Never concatenate user input directly into outputs

### Data Protection

1. **Data at Rest**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data in storage
   - Use industry-standard encryption algorithms
   - Secure key management procedures
   - Implement proper access controls to encrypted data
   - Regularly test backup and recovery procedures

2. **Data in Transit**:
   - Use TLS for all data transmissions
   - Implement certificate validation
   - Configure secure TLS parameters
   - Monitor for encryption degradation
   - Implement certificate rotation procedures

### Error Handling and Logging

1. **Secure Error Handling**:
   - Do not expose sensitive data in error messages
   - Use generic error messages for users
   - Log detailed errors for troubleshooting
   - Handle exceptions securely
   - Maintain consistent error handling patterns

2. **Security Logging**:
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Protect log data from unauthorized access
   - Include necessary context in logs
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies
   - Never log sensitive data like passwords or keys

## Financial Data Security Requirements

Given our focus on financial pre-accounting, special attention must be given to:

### 1. Financial Data Classification

Classify financial data by sensitivity:

- **Public**: Information safe for public disclosure

### 3. Financial Reporting Security

Secure financial reporting processes:

- **Report Access Control**: Strict controls on report access
