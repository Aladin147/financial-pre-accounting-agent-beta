# ADR 0001: Storage Repository Pattern

## Status

Accepted (April 2025)

## Context

The Financial Pre-Accounting Agent Beta requires a storage mechanism for persisting application data including:
- Financial documents (invoices, receipts, statements)
- Extracted financial data
- Generated reports
- Application settings
- User preferences

The system has several requirements that influence the storage design:
1. It must work in a standalone desktop environment without requiring external services
2. It needs to support future extensions for network sharing and potential cloud synchronization
3. It should integrate with the existing service-oriented architecture
4. It must maintain data integrity and support versioning
5. It should provide a consistent API for all application components
6. It needs to support varied query patterns (by ID, by criteria, with sorting/pagination)

We needed to decide on a storage architecture that would fulfill these requirements while allowing for future extensibility.

## Decision

We will implement the **Repository Pattern** with the following components:

1. **IStorageRepository**: An interface defining standard storage operations
2. **FileSystemRepository**: A concrete implementation using the local file system
3. **StorageService**: A service integrating repository operations with the application's service architecture

The Repository Pattern will provide a clean abstraction over the actual storage mechanism, allowing us to:
- Start with a local file system implementation
- Add additional implementations later (network, cloud) without changing application code
- Maintain a consistent API for all application components
- Test storage operations independently from actual storage mechanisms

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Direct File System Access

**Pros:**
- Simplest approach
- Direct control over file operations
- No abstraction overhead

**Cons:**
- No common interface for future storage mechanisms
- File handling code scattered throughout the application
- Difficult to test
- Less consistency in error handling

### 2. Embedded Database (e.g., SQLite)

**Pros:**
- Transactional safety
- SQL query capabilities
- Built-in concurrency handling

**Cons:**
- Requires SQLite bindings and dependencies
- Less flexible for document-oriented data
- Migration complexity
- Installation dependencies

### 3. Third-Party Storage Libraries

**Pros:**
- Pre-built functionality
- Potentially more optimized
- May include additional features (encryption, compression)

**Cons:**
- External dependencies
- May not align with all requirements
- Less control over implementation details
- Potential licensing issues

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Abstraction**: Clean separation between storage mechanism and business logic
2. **Testability**: Easy to create mock repositories for testing
3. **Extensibility**: New storage mechanisms can be added without changing consumer code
4. **Consistency**: Common API and error handling across all storage operations
5. **Phased Implementation**: Start with simple file system storage, expand to more complex mechanisms later
6. **Integration**: Fits well with the existing service architecture

### Negative

1. **Complexity**: More complex than direct file system access
2. **Performance**: Minor overhead from the abstraction layer
3. **Development Time**: Requires implementing the full repository pattern rather than just direct storage
4. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the repository pattern and services architecture

### Neutral

1. **File Format**: JSON files for storage (flexible, human-readable, but less space-efficient)
2. **Directory Structure**: Categorized by entity type, further organized by metadata
3. **Metadata Handling**: Standard fields (id, createdAt, updatedAt, version) on all entities

## Implementation Details

### Interface

```javascript
class IStorageRepository {
  async save(entityType, entity, options = {}) { /* ... */ }
  async getById(entityType, id, options = {}) { /* ... */ }
  async query(entityType, criteria = {}, options = {}) { /* ... */ }
  async delete(entityType, id, options = {}) { /* ... */ }
  async count(entityType, criteria = {}) { /* ... */ }
  async bulkSave(entityType, entities, options = {}) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### File Storage Organization

```
/data
  /{entityType}       # e.g., /documents, /reports, /settings
    /{id}.json        # Individual entity files
  /metadata.json      # Storage metadata, version info
```

### Entity Structure

```javascript
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",       // Required, generated if not provided
  "createdAt": "2025-04-03T...",   // ISO timestamp of creation
  "updatedAt": "2025-04-04T...",   // ISO timestamp of last update
  "version": 3,                    // Incremented on each update
  
  // Entity-specific fields
  "field1": "value1",
  "field2": "value2"
}
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Synchronization**: Implement change tracking to support future sync capabilities
2. **Encryption**: Add optional encryption for sensitive data
3. **Compression**: Consider compression for large datasets
4. **Network Storage**: Add network share implementation
5. **Cloud Storage**: Add cloud sync implementation when appropriate

## Implementation Timeline

1. Phase 1: File system repository implementation
2. Phase 2: Advanced querying and indexing
3. Phase 3: Export/Import capabilities
4. Phase 4: Network sharing support
5. Future: Cloud synchronization (undetermined timeline)
