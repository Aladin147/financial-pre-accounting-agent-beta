## Overview

This document establishes principles and standards for architectural excellence in the Financial Pre-Accounting Agent Beta project. It serves as a guide for making consistent, high-quality architectural decisions that support the project's goals of reliability, maintainability, scalability, and security.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Service-Oriented Architecture

Our application follows a service-oriented architecture with the following principles:

- **Service Encapsulation**: Each service should have clearly defined boundaries
- **Service Independence**: Services should function independently with minimal coupling
- **Interface-First Design**: Define service interfaces before implementation
- **Contract Adherence**: Services must adhere to their defined contracts

### 2. Separation of Concerns

Our architecture should enforce separation of concerns at all levels:

- **Layer Separation**: UI, business logic, and data access layers clearly separated
- **Feature Isolation**: Features organized into cohesive, loosely coupled modules
- **Responsibility Focus**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Security, logging, error handling implemented consistently

### 3. Dependency Management

Dependencies should be managed with care to prevent coupling issues:

- **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies flow toward stability
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies are explicitly declared, not hidden
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Each component has minimal external dependencies

### 4. Configuration Management

Configuration should be managed consistently across the application:

- **Environment-Specific Config**: Configuration varies by environment
- **Centralized Config**: Configuration consolidated in designated locations
- **Default Values**: Sensible defaults provided for all configuration
- **Secret Management**: Sensitive information managed securely

### 5. Error Management

Error handling should be consistent and comprehensive:

- **Error Boundaries**: Errors contained within defined boundaries
- **Consistent Reporting**: Errors reported in consistent format
- **Appropriate Detail**: Error messages include appropriate detail level
- **Graceful Degradation**: System degrades gracefully in error conditions

## Architectural Standards

### Component Standards

1. **Reusability**: Components designed for reuse where appropriate
2. **Statelessness**: UI components stateless where possible
3. **Composition**: Complex components built through composition
4. **Consistency**: Similar components follow consistent patterns
5. **Documentation**: Components documented with clear examples

### Service Standards

1. **Registry Integration**: Services registered with ServiceRegistry
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Clear service lifecycle (init, start, stop)
3. **Health Reporting**: Services expose health/status information
4. **Configuration**: Services configurable via standard mechanisms
5. **Error Propagation**: Consistent error handling and propagation

### Data Access Standards

1. **Repository Pattern**: Data access through repository interfaces
2. **Query Optimization**: Queries designed for performance
3. **Transactional Integrity**: Transactions used appropriately
4. **Data Validation**: Input validation at all data entry points
5. **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching implementation

### Communication Standards

1. **Async Communication**: Asynchronous communication where appropriate
2. **Event-Based Design**: Events for loose coupling between components
3. **Message Formats**: Consistent message formats and schemas
4. **Error Propagation**: Errors propagated appropriately across boundaries
5. **Retry Policies**: Consistent retry policies for communication failures

## Architecture Review Process

### When to Conduct Reviews

Architectural reviews should be conducted for:

1. **New Features**: Features that require architectural decisions
2. **Major Refactoring**: Changes that affect architectural boundaries
3. **Technology Adoption**: Introduction of new technologies
4. **Performance Improvements**: Changes to improve system performance
5. **Security Enhancements**: Changes to improve system security

### Review Participants

Reviews should include:

1. **Architecture Owner**: Technical architect or lead
2. **Implementation Team**: Developers implementing the changes
3. **Stakeholders**: Representatives from affected areas
4. **Subject Matter Experts**: As required for specific topics

### Review Process

1. **Preparation**: Architecture documents prepared and shared in advance
2. **Presentation**: Brief presentation of architectural approach
3. **Discussion**: Open discussion of benefits, drawbacks, alternatives
4. **Decision**: Clear decision documented with rationale
5. **Follow-up**: Action items and next steps defined

### Review Artifacts

The following artifacts should be prepared for architecture reviews:

1. **Architecture Overview**: High-level description of the approach
2. **Component Diagram**: Shows components and their relationships
3. **Sequence Diagrams**: Shows interactions between components
4. **Data Model**: Shows data structures and relationships
5. **Decision Matrix**: Compares alternatives with pros and cons

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Design Anti-Patterns

1. **God Object**: Components that know or do too much
2. **Tight Coupling**: Excessive dependencies between components
3. **Feature Envy**: A component that uses too many features of another component
4. **Shotgun Surgery**: A change that requires multiple components to be modified
5. **Leaky Abstraction**: Abstractions that expose implementation details

### Implementation Anti-Patterns

1. **Magic Strings/Numbers**: Unexplained constants in code
2. **Reinventing the Wheel**: Creating custom solutions for solved problems
3. **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before understanding performance needs
4. **Hardcoded Configuration**: Configuration embedded in code
5. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error handling approaches

### Service Anti-Patterns

1. **Service Sprawl**: Too many fine-grained services
2. **Chatty Services**: Excessive communication between services
3. **Service Coupling**: Services with knowledge of each other's implementation
4. **Shared Databases**: Multiple services sharing a database
5. **Inconsistent Interfaces**: Services with inconsistent interface patterns

## Architecture Evolution

### Planning for Change

1. **Versioning Strategy**: Clear strategy for versioning components
2. **Deprecation Process**: Process for deprecating obsolete components
3. **Migration Paths**: Clear paths for migrating to new architectures
4. **Feature Flags**: Using feature flags for gradual rollout
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Standards for maintaining compatibility

### Technical Debt Management

1. **Debt Identification**: Process for identifying technical debt
2. **Debt Classification**: Framework for classifying debt severity
3. **Debt Tracking**: System for tracking and prioritizing debt
4. **Debt Reduction**: Strategy for systematically reducing debt
5. **Debt Prevention**: Practices to prevent new debt accumulation
